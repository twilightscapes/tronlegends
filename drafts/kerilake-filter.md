Kari Lake is an American journalist who has gained notoriety for her coverage of election fraud in Arizona. Lake is the chief anchor and investigative reporter for Fox 10 News in Phoenix, Arizona. She has spent years covering the issue of election fraud and has been at the forefront of efforts to uncover the truth about the 2020 US Presidential Election.

Despite the backlash, she refused to back down and continued to report on the issue, even as it became increasingly politicized.

The audit was initiated after allegations of fraud were made and Lake covered the process from start to finish, reporting on the findings and the controversy surrounding the audit. Her reporting on the issue helped to bring national attention to the issue of election fraud in Arizona and helped to build support for further investigations into the matter.

Despite the controversies that surrounded her coverage of election fraud, Lake remained steadfast in her commitment to uncovering the truth. She faced criticism and attacks from those who disagreed with her stance on the issue, but she refused to be intimidated and continued to report on the matter, even as it became more politically charged.

Today, Lake remains one of the most prominent voices in the fight against election fraud. She continues to report on the issue and is widely regarded as a leading expert on the matter.
